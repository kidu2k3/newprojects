Architecture Components for Your Alternative Internet
Here's what you need to make it work:

1. üîê Client App (User Gateway)
Purpose: Connects users to the network via WireGuard

Functionality:

WireGuard tunnel setup (embedded config or dynamic provisioning)

Handles DNS routing to internal .alt services

Optional peer discovery/rotation system (load-balancing or relay selection)

Tech Stack:

WireGuard-go or native OS integration (via wgctrl, wireguard-tools)

Electron, Tauri, or native app for GUI

Bootstraps config from trusted relay or hardcoded nodes

2. üåê Private Addressing (IPv6 ULA)
Use: fc00::/7 space for every device (similar to 10.0.0.0/8 in IPv4)

Example subnet: fd42:1337:beef::/48

Benefits:

Globally unique (within your network)

No IP collisions

Easily routable across all relays

3. üß≠ Internal DNS Network
Your Own DNS System for .alt, .neo, etc.

Authoritative Servers: BIND9 / PowerDNS / CoreDNS

Recursive Resolvers: Unbound / CoreDNS for internal lookups

DNS Routing:

Force clients to use internal DNS (pushed via WG config)

Split DNS (internal .alt + internal mirrors of .com etc. if you want clones)

DNS over WireGuard: Already encrypted by tunnel, so plain UDP works fine internally

Optional: DNSSEC, blockchain-based DNS (e.g., Handshake, Namecoin)

4. üöá WireGuard Relay Mesh
Your backbone network

All traffic routed across nodes that form a "mesh internet"

Each node has:

WG public key

Internal ULA address (IPv6)

Routing table for subnet reachability

Routing Options:

Full mesh (everyone talks to everyone)

Multi-hop (user ‚Üí relay ‚Üí content)

BGP over WireGuard (using FRR or BIRD)

5. üñ•Ô∏è Internal Services
Host apps that live only on the alt-internet:

Static/dynamic websites (hosted via NGINX or Caddy)

Messaging apps, storage systems, forums, etc.

Internal APIs, package registries, file sharing

All bound to fdxx:: IPs or .alt domains

No external/public access

You can clone Internet services (Wikipedia, GitHub, etc.) for closed use

6. üìö Content Distribution (Optional)
Mirrors or internal versions of existing websites

Fully offline-capable

Distributed storage (e.g. IPFS, ZeroNet, or your own file CDN)

Versioned packages and cached data

7. üîí Access Control
Identity / Authentication:

Pre-shared WG keys

Central directory server (LDAP, Firebase, or even blockchain-based)

Optional: invite-only or referral-based join process

Permissions:

Per-user routing or domain access

Limited subnet access or layered zones

8. üåç Domain Registry for .alt
A distributed system to manage internal domain names

Approaches:

Central registry (with web portal/API to register .alt names)

Git-based (zone files stored on git repo, synced to DNS nodes)

Blockchain/DHT-based (Namecoin-style system)

Server/Service Summary
Component    Description    Recommended Tech
Relay Nodes    Forward encrypted traffic between nodes    WireGuard, Linux routing
DNS Servers    Resolve .alt and internal hostnames    BIND9, CoreDNS, Unbound
Domain Registry    Manage and propagate .alt namespace    Git + API / Blockchain (e.g. Handshake)
Content Servers    Web, chat, storage, code hosting, etc.    NGINX, Caddy, IPFS, Minio, etc.
Directory/Auth    Manage access control    Firebase / Key server / Custom PKI
Client App    User access & connection    Tauri/Electron + WireGuard-go

üß† Optional Advanced Ideas
Zero-trust access controls inside the network (e.g. per-app WG keys)

Distributed DNS (DHT-based) for true decentralization

Altcoin or reputation token for domain registration

NAT traversal using TURN/DERP if some clients are CG-NAT'ed

Overlay routing protocols (e.g. Yggdrasil, cjdns) over WG for mesh optimization

App Store for internal apps and updates
