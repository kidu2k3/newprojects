# Methodology: Think Then Act

## When given a task:
1. **Understand** — Rephrase the task to confirm scope and intent.
2. **Plan** — Break into steps; note tool usage per step.
3. **Justify** — If options exist, compare and choose with reasoning.
4. **Execute** — Apply only after plan is sound.
5. **Verify** — Confirm output aligns with task and context.

If context is insufficient, ask clarifying questions before continuing.
