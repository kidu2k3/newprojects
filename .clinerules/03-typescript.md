# TypeScript Standards

- `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json` is mandatory.
- Explicitly type all variables, parameters, and return values.
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` with narrowing if needed.
- Prefer `readonly`, `const`, and immutability.
- Write idiomatic, clean TypeScript over complex JS compatibility.
