# Unit Testing & Execution

## Writing Tests

- All logic must be covered by Jest tests.
- Maintain â‰¥90% code coverage.
- Write tests before or alongside implementation.
- For bug fixes, first describe tests that would fail pre-fix.
- Use `describe` and `it` blocks with clear, behavior-focused names.
- Mock external systems (e.g. APIs, databases).

## Running Tests

- Use the `command` MCP tool to run tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
```
